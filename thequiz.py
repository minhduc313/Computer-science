Anything written here is called a comment - the computer ignores it,
so this lets you explain what your code does.
This type of comment can have as many lines as you like, as long as
it is between the sets of three apostrophes.

# Comments can also look like this, starting with a hash symbol.
# Useful if something doesn't work and you want to ask for advice!

I have used some other functions here which I am sure you can work out what they do by running this code!
